Switzerland released their own Llama-3-class model, trained exclusively on public sources while respecting crawler opt-out requests.

The model weights are available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/swiss-ai/apertus-llm-68b699e65415c231ace3b059). I'll try it out when the Ollama files are released -- maybe even ask it for some creative [raclette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raclette) recipes.
