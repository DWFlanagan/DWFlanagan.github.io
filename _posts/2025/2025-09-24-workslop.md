Let’s be considerate about how we use GenAI to write emails, articles, or blog posts. When I first started, it was fun: *Wow, I can crank out a 750-word essay in minutes*! But that’s when you risk outsourcing the thinking. The result? What Stanford researchers call "**workslop**": lots of words, not much value.

> Approximately half of the people we surveyed viewed colleagues who sent workslop as less creative, capable, and reliable than they did before receiving the output. Forty-two percent saw them as less trustworthy, and 37% saw that colleague as less intelligent.

For this post, I didn’t just ask GenAI to write it; we discussed ideas, and I shaped the thinking. If you’re generating 10-page documents that someone else has to decipher, you’re just moving the thinking downstream.

 AI should help you sharpen ideas, not dump text for others to untangle.
