Via [@ErikJonker@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@ErikJonker/114844995036065669):

We've been hearing a lot about MCP lately (e.g. [Wiley Partners with Anthropic to Accelerate Responsible AI Integration Across Scholarly Research](https://newsroom.wiley.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Wiley-Partners-with-Anthropic-to-Accelerate-Responsible-AI-Integration-Across-Scholarly-Research/default.aspx)), but A2A hasn't been on my radar until now.

You can think of A2A as the "meeting room" where agents coordinate and hand off work, while MCP is the "toolbox" each agent uses to get things done. They are complementary technologies.
