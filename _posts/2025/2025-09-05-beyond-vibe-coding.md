Via [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/4/beyond-vibe-coding/):

Addy Osmani has a new book coming out called _Beyond Vibe Coding_. He writes:

> Vibe coding was never meant to describe all AI-assisted coding. It's a specific approach where you don't read the AI's code before running it. There's much more to consider beyond the prototype for production systems.
>
> What is AI-Assisted Engineering?
>
> This goes beyond vibe coding. AI-assisted engineering is a more structured approach that combines the creativity of vibe coding with the rigor of traditional engineering practices. It involves specs, rigor and emphasizes collaboration between human developers and AI tools, ensuring that the final product is not only functional but also maintainable and secure.

Osmani describes practical strategies for collaborating well with AI—moving from quick prototypes to production-ready systems. If you’ve dismissed vibe coding as just a meme, this might change your perspective. It’s about blending speed with structure, creativity with discipline.

Take a look and see what resonates.
