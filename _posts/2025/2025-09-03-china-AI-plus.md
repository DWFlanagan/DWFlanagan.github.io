China released their new "AI Plus" strategy document last week when I was in Beijing. Here is some context and a translation of the policy document (via [Benedict Evans](https://www.ben-evans.com/newsletter/)).

Science and technology research feature prominently:

> ## Accelerate the pace of scientific discovery
>
> Expedite the exploration of AI-driven paradigms for scientific research, shortening the journey from “0 to 1” breakthroughs. Advance the development and application of large-scale scientific models, upgrade fundamental research platforms and major scientific facilities with AI capabilities, build open, high-quality scientific datasets, and enhance the handling of complex cross-modal scientific data. Strengthen AI’s role as a cross-disciplinary catalyst to foster convergent development across multiple fields.
>
> ## Transform R&D models and boost efficiency
>
> Foster an integrated, AI-driven process that spans research, engineering and product roll-out, accelerating the “1 to N” deployment and iterative refinement of technologies and enabling rapid translation of innovations. Promote the adoption of intelligent R&D tools and platforms, intensify AI-enabled co-innovation with bio-manufacturing, quantum technologies, 6G and other frontier domains, ground new scientific achievements in real-world applications, and let emerging application needs steer further breakthroughs.
