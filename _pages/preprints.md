Some content linked here may refer to preprints—manuscripts shared prior to formal peer review. While these are valuable for early feedback and accelerating research, they have not undergone editorial evaluation and may evolve significantly—or even remain unpublished.

This blog includes preprints to reflect emerging ideas, aligned with scholarly best practices and [Wiley’s supportive stance toward preprinting](https://authorservices.wiley.com/author-resources/Journal-Authors/open-access/preprints-policy.html). Nevertheless, please interpret preprint findings cautiously.

Opinions shared here are my own.
